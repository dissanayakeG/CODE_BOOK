**with()**

*we can name the method anything you want with with() in laravel*
```php
return view('index')
    ->withName('Name')
    ->withFullName('Full Name')
    ->withaddress('Your address')
    ->withcountryName('CountryName');
```

*can access the values in view explained below*
```
    withName('Name') in view it becomes $name
    withFullName('Full Name') in view it becomes $fullName
    withaddress('Your address') in view it becomes $address
    withcountryName('CountryName') in view it becomes $countryName
```

*All of the syntax below archives the same thing
```
    return view('blog')->withBlogs($blogs);    
    return view('blog')->with('blogs', $blogs);    
    return view('blog')->with(compact('blogs'));    
    return view('blog', compact('blogs'));
```


**rescue()**

*The rescue function executes the given closure and catches any exceptions that occur during its 
execution. All exceptions that are caught will be sent to your exception handler; however, 
the request will continue processing. Second argument will be the "default" value that should be
 returned if an exception occurs while executing the closure*

```php
return rescue(function () {
    return $this->method();
}, false);
 
return rescue(function () {
    return $this->method();
}, function () {
    return $this->failure();
});
```

**wrap()**

*the make() method create a new instance of a collection from an array. wrap() method is similar
 to make() method, except it will create a collection from any value supplied to it*
 
 ```php
$product = new Product();
$products = Collection::wrap($product);

function addProductsToOrder($products) {
    // Ensure that the products is always a collection.
    Collection::wrap($products)->each->addToOrder();
}
```

**unwrap() is opposite**

*, if the provided value is already a collection, the collectionâ€™s underlying items will be returned.
 If not then the value will be returned as it is without modification.*
